# Which Conviction Envelope rules earn their place — PRE-DECLARED 2026-08-25

## Why

The envelope carries ~20 conditions across four tiers. Some have measurements behind them
(`chase_into_extended_aligned_trend` from `trend_direction_test.py`, the ML-gating of `biases_MIXED`
from `mixed_flat_test.py`); several were reasoned from first principles and never tested; one
(`conformal_abstain_not_confident`) is provably dead code that can never fire.

The user's observation that prompted this: *"Timeframes are rarely aligning and when they do the move
happened."* Both halves were checked — full alignment is 24.2% of bars (rare, confirmed) and aligned
bars carry the WORST barrier outcome (confirmed) — but the *mechanism* was wrong: outcome is flat
across trend age, so aligned is uniformly bad rather than bad-because-late. That is enough of a
contradiction with a HIGH-conviction gate keyed on alignment to justify testing the whole set.

## The geometry must match what the envelope actually gates

Every measurement so far used a **1 ATR stop / 5R target / 72h** structure. **That is not what the
envelope governs.** The envelope gates the LLM's setup construction, and those setups use the tighter
bands: **stop 2.0 ATR, TP1 1.5 ATR, TP2 2.5 ATR** — i.e. TP1 at **0.75R** and TP2 at **1.25R**.

Testing guards against 5R would answer a question the app never asks. This test therefore uses the
app's real geometry, and reports TP1 and TP2 separately.

## The question, stated as the product asks it

Not *"does this condition correlate with bad outcomes?"* but:

> **Does blocking these bars improve the average outcome of the bars that REMAIN?**

That is what a gate does. A condition can correlate with poor outcomes and still be a bad gate if it
also removes good bars, or removes so many that what is left is unusable.

## Conditions tested

Reconstructible from the v14 feature set:

| condition | envelope tier | reconstruction |
|---|---|---|
| `ML_WIN < 50` | AUTO-FLAT | walk-forward goodR prediction, purged |
| `ML_WIN < 60` | cap LOW | same |
| `ML_WIN < 70` | cap MODERATE | same |
| `biases_MIXED and ML < 70` | AUTO-FLAT | `tfAlignment == 0` AND ML < 70 |
| `alignment_not_full` | cap MODERATE | `abs(tfAlignment) < 2` |
| `chase_into_extended_aligned_trend` | AUTO-FLAT | aligned AND stretched ≥2 ATR from the 200D mean |
| `crypto_bear_regime` | downgrade | price < EMA200 and EMA200 falling |
| `continuation < 2` / `< 3` | cap LOW / MODERATE | momentum-alignment count |

**Not testable here** and excluded rather than guessed: kill conditions, macro proximity, news
conflict, earnings, stock-specific gates (no stock paths in this dataset), and
`conformal_abstain_not_confident` (dead — its flag is declared `false` and never assigned).

## Pre-declared bar

A condition **earns its place** only if ALL hold:

1. **Improves the remainder** — blocking its bars raises the mean net-R of what remains by **≥ 0.02R**
   at TP2 geometry.
2. **Consistent** — positive in **≥ 6 of 9** non-overlapping six-month periods. **Sign count, not
   mean**: on 2026-08-24 a control passed on a mean carried entirely by one outlier period, and the
   same trap is available here.
3. **Not ruinous to coverage** — leaves **≥ 20%** of bars tradeable. A gate that blocks 90% of the
   tape to gain 0.02R has not improved anything, it has stopped trading.

A condition that fails 1 is **noise**. One that passes 1 but fails 2 is **regime-dependent**. One that
passes 1 and 2 but fails 3 is **too expensive to run**.

## What this test cannot conclude

Net R is negative nearly everywhere in this dataset, so "improves" mostly means "less negative". This
ranks the guards against each other; it does **not** establish that any surviving combination is
profitable, and a clean sweep would mean the honest envelope is "do not trade" — which is a real
possible outcome, not a failure of the test.

Nor does it license removing a guard that fails: several exist to prevent a specific known harm
(macro events, earnings) rather than to raise average EV, and those are not measured here at all.
