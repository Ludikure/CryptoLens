# CLAUDE.md — MarketScope (CryptoLens)

## Project Overview

MarketScope is an iOS app for multi-timeframe technical analysis of crypto and stock markets. It computes indicators locally, fetches market data from multiple providers, and sends it to Claude/Gemini AI for analysis with trade setups.

- **Bundle ID:** `com.ludikure.CryptoLens`
- **App Store name:** MarketScope
- **Version:** 1.1 (build 18)
- **Deployment target:** iOS 17.0
- **Xcode:** 16.0
- **Project generator:** XcodeGen (`project.yml`)
- **Xcode project:** `MarketScope.xcodeproj` (not `CryptoLens.xcodeproj`)

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build (must specify project — two .xcodeproj exist)
xcodebuild -project MarketScope.xcodeproj -scheme MarketScope -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build

# Generate project from project.yml (if changed — required after adding/removing files)
xcodegen generate
```

No tests exist. No package manager dependencies (no SPM, CocoaPods, or Carthage).

## Architecture

### Swift App (`CryptoLens/`)

```
App/            → CryptoLensApp.swift (entry), ContentView.swift (4-tab layout)
Services/       → Network services, data stores, push notifications, outcome tracking
Views/          → SwiftUI views (charts, indicators, alerts, settings, outcome dashboard)
Models/         → Data models (Candle, AnalysisResult, TradeSetup, TradeOutcome, etc.)
Indicators/     → Technical indicator computation (RSI, MACD, Bollinger, ADX series, etc.)
Analysis/       → Price action & positioning analyzers
Utils/          → Constants, formatters, helpers, ViewHelpers (shared UI functions), MarketHours
Resources/      → Assets.xcassets
```

### Cloudflare Worker (`marketscope-worker/`)

TypeScript worker that proxies API calls, handles auth, push notifications (APNs), and alert checking via cron. Deployed to `marketscope-proxy.ludikure.workers.dev`.

### Key Patterns

- **`AnalysisService`** (`@MainActor`, `ObservableObject`) is the central coordinator. Owns all network services, publishes results. Hooks into `OutcomeTracker` on each refresh.
- **`YahooFinanceService`** is an **actor** (not a class) — all calls require `await`.
- **`AlertsStore`** and **`FavoritesStore`** are `@MainActor` — all mutations must happen on main thread. `AlertsStore` has `processPendingBackgroundAlerts()` for bridging background-triggered alerts.
- **`Constants.customStocks`** and its accessors (`stock(for:)`, `asset(for:)`) are `@MainActor`.
- **Symbol selection** is unified in `AnalysisService.switchToSymbol()` — both `ContentView` and `FavoritePillsView` delegate to it. It handles cancellation of in-flight requests.
- **Indicator computation** happens in `IndicatorEngine.computeAll()` — pure functions, no side effects. Includes full MACD/ADX/volume ratio series for chart sub-panels.
- **`AnalysisHistoryStore`** serializes all disk I/O on a dedicated `DispatchQueue`.
- **`OutcomeTracker`** tracks trade setup outcomes (entry/SL/TP hits, max excursions) and FLAT/kill outcomes (false conservatism detection). Persists to `~/Library/Caches/trade_outcomes/`.
- **Cache:** `AnalysisService` caches results per-symbol in memory (`resultsBySymbol`) and on disk (`~/Library/Caches/analyses/`). `loadCache` is `nonisolated` to avoid blocking main thread.

### Pre-Computed Flags (Swift → LLM)

The app pre-computes authoritative flags passed to the LLM in the `PRE-COMPUTED FLAGS` section of the user prompt. The LLM must not override these:

- **Regime**: TRENDING/RANGING/TRANSITIONING from ADX + MA alignment + BB squeeze. Staleness tracked via UserDefaults.
- **Bias Alignment**: Daily/4H/1H bias labels with counter-trend pullback detection.
- **Kill Conditions**: divergence_against_bias, counter_move_volume_exceeds, funding_supports_counter, macro_event_within_4h. Duration tracked in candles. Kills-clearing flags (divergence_weakening, volume_normalizing).
- **Macro Risk**: IMMINENT/NEARBY/UPCOMING/ON_HORIZON with conviction caps.
- **Tagged Levels**: S/R, VWAP, POC/VAH/VAL with IN_PLAY/NEARBY/DISTANT proximity and ATR distance.
- **Candle Close Timestamps**: Next 4H and Daily close times.

### Data Flow

1. User selects symbol → `switchToSymbol()` → `selectSymbol()` → `refreshIndicators()`
2. `refreshIndicators` fetches candles from Binance (crypto) or Yahoo/TwelveData/Tiingo (stocks)
3. Candles → `IndicatorEngine.computeAll()` → `IndicatorResult` per timeframe
4. Results assembled into `AnalysisResult` with enrichment (sentiment, fundamentals, derivatives)
5. AI analysis: `runFullAnalysis()` builds prompt from indicators → Claude/Gemini → markdown + trade setups
6. Post-analysis: setups registered with `OutcomeTracker`, FLAT outcomes tracked
7. Each refresh: `OutcomeTracker.trackSetupOutcomes()` and `trackFlatOutcomes()` check prices

### Chart Rendering

`CandlestickChartView` uses **SwiftUI Canvas** for all rendering (candlesticks, grid, EMAs, S/R, Bollinger, selection). Sub-chart panels (RSI, MACD, StochRSI, ADX, Volume) also use Canvas. Gestures are a single unified `DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0)`:
- Quick horizontal swipe (movement before 0.3s) → horizontal pan
- Hold 0.3s then drag → crosshair scrub (Apple Stocks style)
- Vertical movement → passes through to parent ScrollView
- Pinch → zoom (separate MagnificationGesture)

### Market Data Providers

| Provider | Used For | Actor/Class |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Binance | Crypto candles, derivatives, spot pressure | `BinanceService` (class) |
| Yahoo Finance | Stock candles, quotes, fundamentals, options, DXY | `YahooFinanceService` (actor) |
| TwelveData | Stock 4H/1H candles (fallback) | `TwelveDataProvider` (class) |
| Tiingo | Stock candles (fallback) | `TiingoProvider` (class) |
| CoinGecko | Crypto sentiment, Fear & Greed | `CoinGeckoService` (class) |
| Finnhub | Market status, analyst recs, earnings | `FinnhubProvider` (class) |
| FRED (via worker) | Macro data (rates, yields) | `MacroDataService` (@MainActor) |
| FairEconomy | Economic calendar (client-side) | `EconomicCalendarService` (class) |

### Navigation

4-tab layout in `ContentView`: Chart (0), Market (1), Analysis (2), Alerts (3). Tabs 0-2 share a `NavigationStack`; tab 3 (`AlertsView`) gets its own `NavigationStack` from `ContentView`. **Do not add a NavigationStack inside AlertsView.**

## System Prompt Architecture

The AI system prompt (`AnalysisPrompt.swift`) follows a strict 4-step decision tree:
1. **Step 1 — Regime**: Pre-computed label (TRENDING/RANGING/TRANSITIONING), authoritative
2. **Step 2 — Playbook**: Per-regime trading rules
3. **Step 3 — Bias**: Hierarchical resolution using pre-computed labels (Rules 1/2/3). Anti-gaming rules prevent the LLM from overriding labels with raw indicator cherry-picking.
4. **Kill Condition Gate**: Pre-computed kill conditions block setup construction if ANY_KILLED=true. Structured watching output with prerequisites → trigger → re-evaluate.
5. **Step 4 — Trade Setup**: Level + Signal + Risk. Counter-trend pullback setup with mandatory kill checklist (PASS cases only). Conviction: HIGH/MODERATE/LOW/FLAT.

Output includes: Market Regime, Key Levels, Bias (with rule citation), Trade Setup table, Risk Factors (max 3 bullets), Next Decision Point, JSON block.

Economic events split into RECENTLY RELEASED (with actuals, beat/miss) and UPCOMING sections.

## Secrets & API Keys

- **No API keys in the codebase.** All keys are proxied through the Cloudflare Worker.
- `Secrets.xcconfig` exists but contains empty values and is gitignored.
- Worker secrets are set via `wrangler secret put`.
- DXY fetched from Yahoo Finance (`DX-Y.NYB`) via worker with User-Agent header.

## Concurrency Model

- `AnalysisService`, `AlertsStore`, `FavoritesStore`, `MacroDataService`, `ConnectionStatus`, `NetworkMonitor` are all `@MainActor`.
- `YahooFinanceService` is an `actor`.
- Other services (`BinanceService`, `CoinGeckoService`, etc.) are plain classes with no mutable shared state — safe because they're only accessed from `@MainActor` `AnalysisService`.
- `PushService` is an `@MainActor` `enum`. All state (`deviceId`, `authToken`, `isAuthenticating`) is serialized through MainActor. `addAuthHeaders` is `nonisolated` and inlines the keychain key string to avoid actor isolation issues.
- `NavigationCoordinator` is `@MainActor`.
- `OutcomeTracker` and `AnalysisHistoryStore` use dedicated `DispatchQueue`s for disk I/O.
- Use `.task { }` instead of `.onAppear { Task { } }` for async work in views (auto-cancels on disappear).
- Use iOS 17 `onChange` form: `.onChange(of: value) { }` (zero-parameter) or `.onChange(of: value) { old, new in }`.

## Known Remaining Issues (Low Severity)

- No certificate pinning on network calls
- Missing accessibility labels on charts and several interactive elements
- Missing App Group entitlement on main app target (widget can't share data)
- `aps-environment` hardcoded to `development` in entitlements
- Worker: APNs tries sandbox first then production (doubles latency); JWT not cached per cron; cron processes devices sequentially
- Worker: single 752-line index.ts file (should be split into modules)
